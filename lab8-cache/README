This is the handout directory for the CS:APP Cache Lab. 

************************
Running the autograders:
************************

Before running the autograders, compile your code:
    linux> make

Check the correctness of your simulator:
    linux> ./test-csim

Check the correctness and performance of your transpose functions:
    linux> ./test-trans -M 32 -N 32
    linux> ./test-trans -M 64 -N 64
    linux> ./test-trans -M 61 -N 67

Check everything at once (this is the program that your instructor runs):
    linux> ./driver.py

# My Answer
csim.c       Your cache simulator (27/27)
trans.c      Your transpose function (53/53)

# You will modifying and handing in these two files
csim.c_bak	Your cache simulator(original file)
trans.c_bak	Your transpose function(original file)

# Tools for evaluating your simulator and transpose function
Makefile     Builds the simulator and tools
README       This file
driver.py*   The driver program, runs test-csim and test-trans
cachelab.c   Required helper functions
cachelab.h   Required header file
csim-ref*    The executable reference cache simulator
test-csim*   Tests your cache simulator
test-trans.c Tests your transpose function
tracegen.c   Helper program used by test-trans
traces/      Trace files used by test-csim.c

my_show_blong.cpp   Writing for partB to see each block belong to which set
lab8_cpp.cpp        Writing the code at first for I thought csim is cpp file type :-(
